    def numOfWays(self, n: int) -> int:
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        p1 = p2 = 6

        for _ in range(n - 1):
            p1, p2 = (p1 * 3 + p2 * 2) % mod, (p1 * 2 + p2 * 2) % mod

        return (p1 + p2) % mod


test("""
You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).
Given n the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:


Input: n = 1
Output: 12
Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.

Example 2:

Input: n = 5000
Output: 30228214

 
Constraints:

n == grid.length
1 <= n <= 5000
